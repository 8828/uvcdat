C
C   This function forces its argument X to be stored in a
C memory location, thus providing a means of determining
C floating point number characteristics (such as the machine
C precision) when it is necessary to avoid computation in
C high precision registers.
C
C
C On input:
C
C       X = Value to be stored.
C
C X is not altered by this function.
C
C On output:
C
C       CSSTORE = Value of X after it has been stored and
C               possibly truncated or rounded to the single
C               precision word length.
C
C Modules required by CSSTORE:  None
